# cw4-code-quiz
## Description
A challenge that creates a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that progress can be measured.
The whole idea behind this project is to create a time-limited coding quiz where there are array of questions with multiple choice answers. The user will be alerted when answer is right or wrong. The user ia also able to save highscore and initials and able to view list of highscores.
This project was very challenging because the javascript was a bit complicated. I learnt how to create another html and javascript file within the same project and link them together. I also struggled a bit with the timer and setting interval. I researched on how to increase font size of a single element in an array ut i did not quite figure it out.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The user is welcomed to the first page and clicks the start button. The questions are displayed one after the other with different answer choices. There is a timer on the top right side of the page. The user gets an alert for each right or wrong question. If the time ends, the timer displays game over. If the user finishes before the time runs out, finished message is displayed with the user's scroe. The user is then prompted to enter Initials to save highscore. The user can view previous highscores and also has the option to clear the scores with a button.
